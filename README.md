I have successfully completed the assignment. I ran into two issues throughout the completion of this assignment. The first one being, when it came to having my while loop have two conditions to keep going, one of them had to be before the other or else the array would not be sorted corretly. The second problem was in my insertion sort, it had an unnecessary for loop that made my sorting method n cubed instead of n squared. Both of those issues were quickly fixed, and the assignment was completed swiftly.
